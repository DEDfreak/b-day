Prompt (Timeline Visual Overhaul — paste this into Replit):
The timeline needs a complete visual overhaul. Remove the straight vertical line entirely. Here's exactly what I want:

CURVED / WINDING TIMELINE PATH

Replace the straight line with an SVG curved path that winds and snakes down the page — like a winding road or river. It should curve left, then right, then left again as you scroll down, with each memory card sitting naturally along the curve at its corresponding point.
The SVG path should be drawn dynamically to fit the full height of the timeline section and be fully responsive (recalculates on resize).
Each memory card should be positioned along the curve — alternating organically on the left and right sides of the winding path, following its natural flow. Cards should feel like they're resting along a journey, not just stacked in a list.


SCROLL-DRIVEN LIGHT REVEAL EFFECT

The SVG path should start completely unlit / faded — render it in a very dim, barely visible tone like rgba(117, 22, 46, 0.15).
As the user scrolls down, a glowing light traces the path from top to bottom — like lighting up a trail. Use a stroke-dashoffset animation tied to the scroll position using JavaScript. As the user scrolls further, more of the path gets "lit up" in a warm glowing color (#75162E or a warm golden #C8843A glow).
Add a soft glowing dot (like a firefly or candle flame) that travels along the path ahead of the revealed section — it should pulse gently and move smoothly as the user scrolls, staying just at the leading edge of the lit portion.
The glow effect should have a soft blur/bloom around it — use CSS filter drop-shadow or a blurred duplicate SVG element underneath to create a warm halo around the lit path.


CARD ENTRANCE ANIMATIONS

As the glowing dot reaches each memory card's position on the path, that card should animate in — not just a simple fade, but something more dramatic:

The polaroid photo should drop in from slightly above with a gentle bounce, as if someone just pinned it to a board.
The text content slides in from the side opposite to the photo.
A small heart or spark burst plays at the path node point when that memory unlocks.


Cards that haven't been reached yet by the scroll should remain invisible or very ghosted out (opacity ~0.05) so the focus is always on the currently revealed section.


ATMOSPHERE

Add a very subtle parallax effect to the background of the timeline section — a faint texture or pattern (soft floral, noise, or bokeh dots) that moves slightly slower than the scroll, giving a sense of depth.
The overall section background should be the warm cream #F2E5C5 but with a gentle radial vignette darkening toward the edges, keeping the eye focused on the winding path in the center.


TECHNICAL NOTES FOR REPLIT

Use vanilla JS with window.addEventListener('scroll', ...) and SVGPathElement.getTotalLength() + getPointAtLength() to drive the dot position along the path.
The SVG should be position: absolute behind all the cards, spanning the full height of the timeline container.
Make sure this is fully responsive — on mobile, the path can simplify to gentler curves (less dramatic winding) so cards still fit cleanly.
Comment every major block of code clearly so edits are easy later.
